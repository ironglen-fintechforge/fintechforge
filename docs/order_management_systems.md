    quantity: Decimal
    order_type: OrderType  # MARKET, LIMIT, STOP
    limit_price: Optional[Decimal] = None
    stop_price: Optional[Decimal] = None
    time_in_force: TimeInForce = TimeInForce.DAY
    account: str
    portfolio: str
    strategy: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: datetime
    created_by: str
